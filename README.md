# XDC IDP Client

This is a example client integrating with the XDC IDP, or any OIDC provider.

## XDC IDP

XDC IDP is Open ID Connect provider that handles the communication with non-standard based identity providers, e.g. Swedish BankID. You can read more about XDC IDP [here](https://www.xenit.se/erbjudande/tjanster/sakerhetstjanster/xdc-idp/).

## Goals for this repo

We want to provide a quick example that could be used as a starter application to get going with any OIDC provider.
